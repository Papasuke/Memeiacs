        <h1 class="IT-section">IT WORK</h1>
            <p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1">The IT professional that has agreed to be interviewed by our team is called Nhat Trung, currently working as a data analyst for the banking industry. As the world is becoming more digitized and people are quickly switching to cards instead of cash payments, the banking industry is growing to a new height each year. Trung builds and maintains reporting systems with Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) and Microsoft Power BI Report Server and provides support to the end users. 
                The department that he works in interacts with the sales center to understand customer needs and help them improve their sales performance as well as with the internal infrastructure department who supports them by keeping the servers running the systems. The most time spent on his work is in analyzing and building data for the reporting system, and the most challenging part of the job is designing and implementing a new system as it requires all technical aspects and timeline. Trung believes that the essence of the IT industry is to provide the end users services with the best quality and improve people’s lives.
                Regarding his personal experience in the IT industry, Trung shares that he didn’t choose his career but instead it chose him. He has always been interested in programming since high school. For someone coming into the industry, he suggests reading newspapers and catching up on IT trends such as the future with AI. Trung has been a part of his company for over 5 years and is seeing himself retiring with it. 
                Trung works from 8AM to 5PM everyday and finds 40 hours a week enough. His favorite tradition/culture in the company is the rewards when one utilises creativity and creates something new, whether it’s a design or a system or a new solution to improve efficiency. Our IT professional is an ESTP who is known as the doers and enjoys listening to music, playing MMO strategy games as well as tennis. We asked him what advice he would give his past self and Trung said to “choose a certain career and do it best”. Trung has an interesting work-life balance and he’s doing great in the IT section of the banking industry. He was an interesting person to interview and get to know.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer">

            <H3>Cybersecurity</H3>
                <p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1">By looking at Cyber Security Degrees (2021), we can see that there have been numerous new and innovative technologies developed. We have been successful in developing a behavioral analytics system. This will allow us to better predict and respond to threats much more quickly than we were previously able to. We can even prevent an attack before it has a chance to start. This can be used in a variety of different applications. We have improved the efficiency with which we create behavior profiles compared to previous years. A subject's daily routine, their activities, and other factors can be used to create a behavioral profile of them. We will be able to predict when someone is in danger or engaging in unusual behavior, and we will be able to intervene and assist them before something disastrous occurs. This can be used to predict when a cyber attack is going to occur, which is extremely useful. We can gather hacker information and habits, and then predict where and when they will carry out their attack based on this information and habits. What we are looking for is the IP addresses of the hackers as well as their objectives and methods of hacking. We can prevent the attack from taking place if we keep this information in mind. And make algorithms that will take advantage of this information and help us predict the hacker’s behaviours. This is another application of a behaviour analytics system. Another thing we've been able to accomplish is Virtual Dispersive Networking, which is a type of distributed computing (also known as VDN). This allows us to divide our information into multiple parts, encrypt them, and route them through a variety of different protocols at the same time. The attack on information will be significantly more difficult as a result of this. In addition, because the data is dispersed and encrypted, even if the hacker manages to get past the security wall, they will be unable to obtain much data using traditional hacking methods. We can store information in a much more secure manner if we use this method. Another thing that we have been able to accomplish is to use smart grid technology as a security measure. With Padlock, we can establish a more secure communication channel between the central station and field devices, making it less likely that we will be targeted by an attacker. I believe that in the future, we will be able to combine all of these new technologies to create a more secure system, one that will be more difficult to attack in the traditional manner. We will be able to incorporate artificial intelligence into cyber security to assist us in the development of a more secure and strict cyber security system. The process of developing a security system will take less time and may even be more effective with the assistance of artificial intelligence. Hardware development and personal skill development have both advanced in recent years, which has made all of this a possibility. Our ability to obtain more powerful hardware than ever before will allow us to pursue a much wider range of routes and development paths that would have previously seemed impossible. We learn from our mistakes and strive to improve in areas where we fall short. Along with this, we have improved our personal programming skills and created a security system.
                    As a result of all of these developments, we will live in a more secure world. Our information can be safely stored on the Internet without causing us any problems. In the future, we will have a much stronger justification for storing our information online rather than in hard copy forms. The people, as well as the hackers, will most likely be the ones who are affected the most as a result of this. People will be more willing to have the information available online if they do not have to worry about their belongings being lost or being stolen. A personal security system that performs as well as an industrial security system will be available to the general public. People's lives will be made significantly easier as a result of this. Hackers, on the other hand, are the ones who will bear the brunt of the consequences. They will be less successful in their hacking and information-gathering efforts for malicious purposes. As a result, there will be fewer hackers, and those who do remain will most likely be the best of the bunch. Hackers, on the other hand, can adapt their methods and approaches to the new security system. This is the essence of hacking; they will adapt to the situation and look for a weakness in the system to exploit. Additionally, we will see a decrease in the number of white hats, or those who hack into a system and then sell their method back to the company they hacked into. This could be a negative development because we will not receive as much information about system flaws and errors as we did in the past.
                    In all honesty, I do not believe that this would have a significant impact on my life because it is a problem that other important people must deal with. I might be more willing to give my information to companies and corporations since they are less likely to be hacked, and so my information will not be gathered illegally. This will allow me and my acquaintances to have a more positive experience when working with a large corporation. When it comes to how our information is stored and processed, we will have a more secure feeling about it. However, in terms of daily habits or activities, I do not believe that there will be any significant changes. The latest technologies or security systems that have been developed personally do not matter to me. I only choose to use them after they have proven to be more stable and reliable in their performance.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer">

            <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
                <p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1">As can be seen in Analytics Insight (2021), significant progress has been made in the field of AI by 2021. The use of AI in the creation of behavior profiles to predict the possibility of what might happen next is the most notable. It is used to predict and respond to threats as soon as they appear, rather than waiting until they have occurred. This process will become more automated as a result of AI, which will save us a significant amount of manpower and time. We can also see from Appen (2021) that many companies and businesses have begun to incorporate AI into their applications. It can be found in both external and internal applications of various kinds. Despite the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic was a truly devastating event, it provided an opportunity for AI and machine learning to advance much more quickly than they had previously. We have been able to incorporate AI into a wide range of daily and professional activities, allowing them to become more automated. This year has demonstrated both the potential applications of AI and the rapidity with which the technology is evolving. We've never used them as much as we do now. Our shortcomings remain, despite all of our advantages. Finding and developing a machine learning model continues to be a difficult task to complete successfully. Finding precise, high-quality data to train the model is still a significant barrier to the advancement of AI. If we want to really push the capabilities of AI, those are the problems that we must face head on and find solutions for all of the current ones. One of the most straightforward things that AI has been able to accomplish is using our personal data to provide us with suggestions and advertisements based on what we like or are interested in learning more about. Another application is the automatic driving system in an electric vehicle. Although I do not foresee this happening in the near future, I do believe that many aspects of our lives will be automated, making life a little bit easier. We could likely have AI products that will assist us in studying by going over our previous study history and assisting us in choosing the right path that will be the most beneficial to us. The development of a more refined automatic driving system for electric vehicles is yet another possibility to be considered. With enough time and data training, we can create a system that can even navigate the streets and traffic of Vietnam – very complicated and, at times, chaotic streets with a lot of traffic – and get lost in it. For this type of development to occur, there are two primary reasons for it. The first of these is the advancement in technology. We have been getting a lot more powerful computing hardware in recent years. This has enabled us to obtain more accurate information and simulations in order to collect data to train the model. The second reason is that we have been able to improve our AI programming methods and approaches as a result of this experience. The programmers have improved their abilities over the previous years. We can learn from our mistakes and apply what we have learned to future tasks. In order for AI to make such a quantum leap in 2021, an opportunity had to present itself; in this case, COVID-19 represents that opportunity. A strong desire for AI usage has arisen, which has resulted in the development of AI becoming increasingly successful.
                    As a result of all of these breakthroughs and advancements in AI technologies, we have been able to do our jobs more efficiently and make our jobs a lot easier. We've also been able to put them to use in our everyday lives. It makes our lives more convenient and allows things to happen much more quickly than they did previously. With the assistance of AI technologies, we can engage in more productive activities or complete more work. It can assist us in automating tasks that we previously had to complete manually. Unless people learn how to adapt to the new technology, it will not result in their losing their jobs. Although it can be extremely beneficial when used correctly, it can also cause people to become lazier if they become overly reliant on it. This process of automation using AI has the potential to render former technologies obsolete, such as jobs that required manual labor in the past. Still, new jobs will be created to fix and manage this new AI technology, which will continue to be a constant source of growth.
                    I don't believe it would have a significant impact on me because I always wait for a technology to become stable and dependable before putting it to use. However, because I intend to work as an AI engineer in the future, I will need to become accustomed to testing and implementing new AI technology, methods, and models. If I want to get the most out of AI development, I'll have to learn to go with the flow. I also have to think about and learn a new coding method, as well as find new training data for my AI. With regard to the members of my family and friends, it is unlikely that they will experience any significant changes in the near future. They will hold off on utilizing this type of technology until the appropriate time has come along.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer">

            <h3>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h3>
                <p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1">Blockchain - also known as Distributed Ledger Technology - is a shared database that makes any digital asset unalterable and transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic hashing. (George Strawn 2019) A simple analogy would compare blockchain to a Google Docs, where a shared document is distributed instead of copied or transferred, which creates a decentralized distribution system that allows every party access at the same time. Blockchain is one of the most important technologies of the century as it makes everything safer and prevents fraud by being transparent. Blockchain is known for being a secure technology, where people who are skeptical of one another can share valuable data because it uses complex math and innovative software rules that are extremely difficult to hack into. (Mike Orcutt 2018) Blockchain, to be simply explained, is a chain of blocks, each consisting of data, hashcode and hashcode of the previous block. A hash is a 256-bit number created from a 32-bit nonce - also known as a number that used once, extremely unique like a fingerprint. Since each block contains the information of the previous hash, the first block ever does not have that information and is called the genesis block. If a hacker changes the information in one of the blocks then the hash changes, and the validation of the next block will fail, so will the next block and next blocks. But it can be saved with “proof-of-work” which slows down the creation of a new block. If a hacker tampers with one block, they have to recalculate the proof-of-work for all the following blocks. Not only that, blockchain uses a peer-to-peer network that allows people access to the whole chain on something called a node. A node is any kind of electronic device that maintains the network and verifies each batch of network transactions called blocks. When a new block is created, the node verifies the block and adds it to the chain. (George Strawn 2019) Thus, it is tedious and complicated, making blockchain very hard to hack into. One other concept relating to blockchain are miners, those creating new blocks in a process called mining. One has to go through around 4 billion nonce-hash combinations to be able to successfully mine a block. When that happens, the miner is rewarded financially and the block is accepted by nodes on all networks. Blockchains make cryptocurrencies available. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use encryption techniques to control the monetary units and verify the transfer of funds which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit. One of the most famous cryptocurrency is Bitcoin. Currently, cryptocurrencies can be traded using the blockchain technology worldwide, and investors make profit from the difference between when they buy and when they sell. Aside from that, NFT - also known as non-fungible tokens - are quickly becoming the future of blockchain technology. Such as collectibles that exist in real life now can be digitized and profited from. Soon, our digital identity will also use the blockchain system to make it unique to the user and a lot more secure, replacing username and passwords right now. Blockchain essentially acts like a cybersecurity system and is expected to be implemented in companies in the future. (Gayvoronskaya, et al. 2020)
                    The possibilities using blockchain are endless. It can make data storing and transferring secure, helping companies save millions of dollars and CEOs fear of losing valuable intellectual property. Blockchain usually goes alongside cryptocurrencies, which is available to the public and mainly traded by investors. Following the cryptos, there are NFTs that are on the rise and are making the future of blockchain, all of which are safe and secure in this network. The people mostly associated with these technologies can be anyone. In the future, blockchain will replace identity recognition systems like username and passwords that are used today.
                    As someone who trades cryptocurrencies and stocks in my free time, blockchain is a very fascinating concept for me. It is currently used to make networks safe and eases my worries about being hacked. A lot of my friends and family also trade on the side and are very familiar with blockchain and cryptocurrencies and even NFTs, the impact of this technology on us is very big and if it were to fail either because a hacker successfully infiltrates and tampers with the blocks, my investments could be gone within seconds. It matters a lot to me that blockchain works correctly and I feel safe about its security.
                    I don't believe it would have a significant impact on me because I always wait for a technology to become stable and dependable before putting it to use. However, because I intend to work as an AI engineer in the future, I will need to become accustomed to testing and implementing new AI technology, methods, and models. If I want to get the most out of AI development, I'll have to learn to go with the flow. I also have to think about and learn a new coding method, as well as find new training data for my AI. With regard to the members of my family and friends, it is unlikely that they will experience any significant changes in the near future. They will hold off on utilizing this type of technology until the appropriate time has come along.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer">

            <h3>Natural Language Processing and Chatterbots</h3>
                <p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1">Natural Language Processing or NLP for short used to be a subfield of linguistics and transformed to a branch of computer science, significantly using artificial intelligence that allows the computer to comprehend text and spoken language much like a human can. Another way to describe it is the automatic manipulation of language by software. Combining statistical machine learning, deep learning models, NLPs can fully understand speech and text with the speaker or writer’s full intent or sentiment. NLPs can get computers to translate text, respond to commands or summarize lange text rapidly in real time. (IBM Cloud Education 2020) In real life, NLPs can be seen everywhere such as GPS, Alexa, Siri or other digital assistants, speech-to-text recognition software, and so on. One of the growing uses for NLP also comes from chatbots, which are becoming increasingly present in our everyday lives. Businesses use chatbots to facilitate the interaction with customers and provide answers and services quicker, leading to a more profitable business. Chatbots are computer programs that are designed to communicate with humans through the internet via chat interface or by voice, much like how humans interact with each other. There are three main types of chatbots, the first one is the most simple one: <span>rule-based chatbots</span>. These bots have pre-written code about the questions and answers so users can click a button and the bots retrieve the answer. However, it usually cannot respond in detail and specifically to the user, making it the simplest but slowest guide. The second one is <span>intellectually independent chatbots</span>. These bots use machine learning to communicate, which means that they are fed large enough amounts of data to learn the connection between problems and solutions. These bots also learn from their interactions with users and become better at recognizing keywords and faster at retrieving answers. The third one is <span>AI-powered chatbots</span>, these are the combination of the other two, making it more advanced. The technology that is put into these chatbots are machine learning, NLPs and AI, all used to understand and analyze human speech, find the right response and answer in human language. (Botscrew 2017) Currently, chatbots are implemented by many companies to work on messaging apps, which is becoming more popular than the social media apps. Companies can even target the right demographics depending on the user, making their chatbots more efficient. Facebook has done a market research regarding the value of bots, and has revealed that 2 billion messages are sent between companies and customers monthly, 56% of those prefer receiving help from companies through messages and 53% are more likely to make a purchase from companies that can message. I believe that there are many potentials for chatbots and NLPs in the future. Soon, chatbots may even gain “personality” and speak in a more relevant way such as making use of teen language for companies that target the younger generation. A famous case of company personality is Wendy’s with their sassy attitude on the internet, and this energy can be brought into their chatbots as well. Our human language is unstructured text that is ever growing with new “made-up” words every once in a while. NLPs will continue to improve themselves to be able to connect humans and technology better.
                    Language is the core of human’s social life, helping people communicate and understand each other. Before, language was used to signal danger or new locations. Overtime, human language becomes a lot more complicated, where each civilization speaks different languages, where they can express feelings and sentiments, etc. Right now, technology is learning our language, but is still held back by the limitations of AI and machine learning. In the future, this will change, and NLPs will become smarter, chatbots will become more human, and the connection between technology and humans will be stronger. 
                    For me, NLPs and chatbots are very important as many of my friends and family run small businesses that can get too busy to answer and satisfy every customer looking for support. Chatbots come in as digital helpers, giving quick answers at any time of day, even in the middle of the night when customers are panicking about their products. Of course, right now, chatbots and especially intelligent chatbots are still not too common for business owners, but in the near future hopefully AI chatbots will become the norm and facilitate the interactions both for the company and the customers. As someone who is planning on opening a business in the future, I am eager to see how NLPS and chatbots evolve and improve.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer">
